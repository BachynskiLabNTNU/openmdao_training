# openmdao_training

This repo contains slides and tutorial scripts to help users get started with NASA's [OpenMDAO](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/openmdao).  This version is modified from the original (with new Lab 0 and Lab 1 examples) for the SFI BLUES Optimization Workshop, held in June 2022.
When given in a workshop, this material should take about 6 hours to complete.
With this repo, you will be able to go through the slides and scripts at your own pace.

To get started:

0. If you don't already have Python installed, download and install [Anaconda Python 3.10](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).
1. After that, follow [OpenMDAO's installation instructions](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/openmdao).
2. Then you can go through the `openmdao_workshop` powerpoint or pdf file (not yet uploaded), which will guide you through concepts within OpenMDAO and walk you through the tutorial scripts.
