# openmdao_training

This repo contains slides and tutorial scripts to help users get started with NASA's [OpenMDAO](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/openmdao).
When given in a workshop, this material should take about 6 hours to complete.
With this repo, you will be able to go through the slides and scripts at your own pace.

To get started:

0. If you don't already have Python installed, download and install [Anaconda Python 3.7](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).
1. After that, follow [OpenMDAO's installation instructions](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/openmdao).
2. If you're looking for motivation to use OpenMDAO, check out the [`motivation_to_use_openmdao.pdf`](https://github.com/johnjasa/openmdao_training/blob/master/motivation_to_use_openmdao.pdf) file in the repo.
3. Then you can go through the `openmdao_workshop` powerpoint or pdf file in the repo, which will guide you through concepts within OpenMDAO and walk you through the tutorial scripts.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please [open an issue](https://github.com/johnjasa/openmdao_training/issues) so we can discuss them.
